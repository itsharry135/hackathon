IoT Based Dustbin

Problem Statement
Improper waste management is one of the biggest challenges that we face today. Overflowing dustbins and littered streets are common sights in cities around the world. The problem is particularly acute in developing countries, where waste management infrastructure is often inadequate. To address this problem, we have developed an IoT-based dustbin that can send the status of the dustbin to a webpage.

Idea and Approach
Our IoT-based dustbin uses ultrasonic sensors to detect the level of waste in the bin. When the bin is full, the sensors send a signal to a microcontroller (in our case, an NodeMCU) that is connected to the internet. The microcontroller sends the status of the dustbin (i.e., whether it is full or empty) to a webpage that can be accessed by anyone with an internet connection.

Our approach involves using low-cost and easily available components to build the IoT-based dustbin. We have used an Arduino board, ultrasonic sensors, and a Wi-Fi module to create a simple and effective system that can be used to monitor the status of dustbins in real-time.
